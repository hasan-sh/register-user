# register-user
This is a basic Registration Functionality. 

## Installation
  - Install the dependencies: 
    1. cd backend/ && npm install 
    2. cd ../client && npm install
   
  - Now run the backend and the cli
    1. cd backend/ && npm start 
    2. cd ../client && npm start
    
    
The client will be opened in your browser and the backend on `localhost:8080/graphql`

  Register and your data will automatically be in the DB :)
